The basic radar equation
=========================

The basic radar equation is used to represent the physical relationships from transmission power to wave propagation and reception. It can be used to determine the power :math:`P_e`  at the input of the radar receiver as a function of the transmission power :math:`P_S`, the distance :math:`R` and the reflection properties of the object :math:`\sigma` . If the sensitivity of the receiver is known, it is thus possible to estimate the range up to which the target object will generate a sufficiently strong echo signal under the given circumstances for it to be recognized by the radar device. The radar equation can be used to assess the operational performance of radar systems.

.. math::

    R_ \text{max}=\sqrt[4]{\frac{P_{s}~G^{2}~\lambda^{2}~\sigma}{P_{e_{min}}(4\pi)^{3}}}

Where, 

| :math:`G=` antenna gain,

| :math:`\lambda=` wavelength
